# Breast Cancer Prediction

## Overview
Breast Cancer Prediction is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features. This project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and implements several classification algorithms to achieve accurate predictions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MirzaWaseem-Baig/Breast-Cancer-Prediction.git
    cd Breast_Cancer_Prediction
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas seaborn scikit-learn matplotlib
    ```

## Datasets
The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data?resource=download).

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression

## Results
The performance of the models is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The best performing model is Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 95%.
